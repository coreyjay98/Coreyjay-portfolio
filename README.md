# My Portfolio

A project created by Corey Samuels.
You can view the site here : https://coreyjay98.github.io/Coreyjay-portfolio/

## Project Description

In this project I created a full portfolio site for myself that I can use to send to future employers and clients. I had already created one previously but that was at the start of my journey into web development and I believe my skills have grew massively since then. I am now able to utilise frameworks and CSS to create a more professional looking site and so giving any user that views it a better first impression of me.

### Usage

This site is a pure front end application and so the link provided will be the only way to view it

### Technologies Used

To create this project I used HTML, CSS and the CSS framework Materialize, this framework was useful for me as it allowed me to create a simple navbar and responsive card layout and was not too intrusive on the code. There was times where I struggled with the framework as they had quite strict rules on their components but I managed to make it work in the end
